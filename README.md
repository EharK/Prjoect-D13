**ADL - Data mining and visualizations in driving recordings of Bolt project**

Various datasets of human and self-driving software driving in Estonia (Tartu, Tallinn, intercity,  rural) were collected in past 3 years. These datasets can be analyzed to extract interesting facts, such as how variable are the trajectories taken by the same human driver in the same route across mutliple runs. Also variability across humans. Also, automatic detection of events (e.g. slowing down due to pedestrian crossing) in the data - this is useful to produce training data for AI. All the datasets are listed here
